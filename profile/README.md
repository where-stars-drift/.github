# Where Stars Drift ✨

> *A canvas-based space simulation library where universes emerge from code*

**Where Stars Drift** is a TypeScript library for creating interactive space simulations with realistic physics, celestial bodies, and dynamic fleet behaviors. Born from a simple starfield background, it evolved into a complete 2D space engine inspired by classics like Homeworld and Freelancer.

## 🌌 Features

- **Celestial Bodies**: Multiple star types, pulsars, ringed planets, black holes with gravitational effects
- **Dynamic Entities**: Starships with AI behaviors, fleet formations, clans, and tactical movements
- **Visual Effects**: Nebulas, comets, meteors, supernovas, and energy streams
- **Physics Engine**: Real gravity simulation, collision detection, and spatial optimization via quadtree
- **Interactive**: Mouse-driven interactions, hover effects, and responsive animations
- **Framework Agnostic**: Pure canvas rendering with adapters for React, Vue, and Angular

## 📦 Packages

- **Core Library** (Private): The heart of the simulation engine
- **Framework Wrappers** (Public): Easy integration for React, Vue, and Angular
- **Website** (Private): Documentation, demos, and API reference

## 🚀 Getting Started

```typescript
import { createSimulation } from 'where-stars-drift';

const simulation = createSimulation(canvas, {
  stars: 1000,
  blackHoles: 3,
  interactive: true
});
```

## 🌠 Philosophy

Where Stars Drift is a passion project for space enthusiasts, game developers, and creative coders. Every black hole tells a story, every starship has purpose, and every star drifts with intention.
